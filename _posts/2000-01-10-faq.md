1. What are Milestones?
Ans. Milestones are the goals set for the project and will vary from project to project. They are made to gauge the overall completion percentage for the project.

2. What are Pods?
Ans. Each project has 1 mentor and upto 6 mentees, which form together a pod. Each pod is focussed on one particular project each and will have a dedicated stream on the official chat platform.

3. Do I have to dedicate my entire time?
Ans. We donâ€™t score on the basis of no. of hours contributed but rather through the no. of commits & PRs. You can work according to your preferences and schedule.

4. What if the mentor or mentee does not respond?
Ans. Your first step should be respectfully reminding the other person. However, if they still fail to respond, do contact us and we will tackle care of the matter.
