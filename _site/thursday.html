      <p class="card-text">There are a lot of websites that are what people refer to as blogging platforms and they are quite popular.
What I thought was that people prefer stuff that offers interaction.
Radio turned to telephone. Text to Whatsapp.
People are inclined towards two way communication and everyone expects that, even if that's subconsciously.<br />

Like if anyone posts something on instagram, they want people to like it and share their thoughts via comments. Same on YouTube.<br />

So that brings us to people who comment. They want their views to be heard. It's human nature.<br />

So I bring to you iBlog. It's a blogging website as you might have guessed. But what's new?<br />

Go ahead and find out..</p>

<ul>
<li>P0: Create a peer to peer video calling solution, based on webRTC or better</li>
<li>P1: introduce machine learning based solutions for audio (and possibly video) quality</li>
<li>P2: Focus on the overall experience, create a better UI, bundle it with text chat, try to make it multi participant.</li>
<li>P3: Use ML to make the experience even smoother with smart suggestions, Audio detection, custom backgrounds.</li>
