<h4>1. What are Milestones?<br /></h4>
<p>Milestones are the goals set for the project and will vary from project to project. They are made to gauge the overall completion percentage for the project.</p>
<hr />

<h4>2. What are Pods?<br /></h4>
<p>Each project has 1 mentor and upto 6 mentees, which form together a pod. Each pod is focussed on one particular project each and will have a dedicated stream on the official chat platform.</p>
<hr />

<h4>3. Do I have to dedicate my entire time?<br /></h4>
<p>We donâ€™t score on the basis of no. of hours contributed but rather through the quality of your commits &amp; PRs. You can work according to your preferences and schedule.</p>
<hr />

<h4>4. What if the mentor or mentee does not respond?<br /></h4>
<p>Your first step should be respectfully reminding the other person. However, if they still fail to respond, do contact us and we will take care of the matter suitably.</p>
